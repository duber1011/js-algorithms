3. **Run the project:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The project currently includes a solution for determining the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can run the solution by executing the `start` script:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the `src/index.js` file, which imports and executes the Tic-Tac-Toe solution with example test cases.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any algorithm exercises you'd like to add or improvements to existing solutions, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate test cases.
