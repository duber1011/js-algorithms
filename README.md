## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/duber1011/js-algorithms.git
   cd js-algorithms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The project currently includes a solution for determining the winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can run the solution by executing the `start` script:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the `src/index.js` file, which imports and executes the Tic-Tac-Toe solution with example test cases.

Also, you can run the project in development mode by executing:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for this project, you can use the following commands:

1. **Run all tests:**

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

2. **Run tests in watch mode:**

   ```sh
   npm run test:watch
   ```

3. **Run tests with coverage:**
   ```sh
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any algorithm exercises you'd like to add or improvements to existing solutions, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.
